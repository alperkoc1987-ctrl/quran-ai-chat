# Adhan Audio Files

This directory should contain the Adhan (Islamic call to prayer) audio files.

## Required Files:

1. **adhan-mishary.mp3** - Adhan by Mishary Rashid Alafasy
2. **adhan-abdul-basit.mp3** - Adhan by Abdul Basit Abdus Samad  
3. **adhan-makkah.mp3** - Adhan from Masjid al-Haram (Makkah)

## Where to get Adhan audio files:

### Option 1: Download from Islamic Audio Libraries
- Search for "Adhan MP3" on Islamic audio websites
- Ensure you have proper licensing/permissions for use

### Option 2: Use existing recordings
- Many mosques and Islamic organizations provide free Adhan recordings
- Popular sources: IslamicFinder, Muslim Pro, Quran.com

### Option 3: Record your own
- Record from a local mosque (with permission)
- Use royalty-free Islamic audio libraries

## File Requirements:

- **Format**: MP3
- **Duration**: 2-5 minutes (full Adhan)
- **Quality**: At least 128 kbps
- **Size**: Keep under 5MB per file for fast loading

## Temporary Solution:

For development/testing, you can use placeholder notification sounds or browser default sounds until you obtain proper Adhan recordings.

The app will gracefully fall back to silent notifications if audio files are missing.
